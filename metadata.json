  "description": "A comprehensive travel itinerary planner that allows users to generate, customize, manage budgets, save, export, import, and manually 'synchronize' trip plans via shareable snapshot links. This is NOT real-time collaboration; loading a link overwrites your current plan. Features include drag-and-drop itinerary editing, budget tracking with currency conversion, contact management, document storage, and PDF export.",
